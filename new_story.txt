Once upon a time there was a boy, he was in charge of watching sheep.
One day, he decided to have some fun and tell a lie.
He went into the city and told everyone that a wolf had come to eat his sheep.
Everyone came to help scare the wolf away, then saw that the boy was really telling a lie, and that there was no wolf.
The next day the boy decided to do the same thing, and he went to the city and told everyone again that there was a wolf eating up his sheep.
Everyone came to help and found out that he was telling a lie.
Everyone was very angry with the boy.
